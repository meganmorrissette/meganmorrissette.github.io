                <p class="work-description">While working at Walgreens, I provided all category insights for the snack, cookie, cracker, nuts, and dried meat categories, which generate $900M/yr for Walgreens USA (8000+ stores). Although I provided weekly insights based on sales and consumer trends, I ran yearly product line reviews to determine the proper product assortments and planogram design to maximize sales and meet customer needs. 
                <br></br>
                To complete this analysis, I analyzed (1) planogram productivity to ensure we were maximizing sales/inch; (2) the effectiveness of our promotions to make sure that they were garnering customer attention and generating strong return on investment (ROI); (3) consumer demands for brands, product type, and product size to ensure we were meeting consumer needs/wants; (4) consumer decision trees to better understand the consumer buying and decision making process; (5) consumer switching behavior to estimate sales shifts that would occur as a result of the introduction or loss of skus; and (6) product pricing. Analysis was primarily completed using IRI syndicated data sourced through Walgreen’s Balance Rewards Cards (largest loyalty program in the USA), which captures 70%+ of all Walgreens sales.
                <br></br>
                Changes made as a result of the line reviews I provided were estimated to generate a +2.5% sales lift (~$23M in 2020 sales). These sales lifts were primarily due to surfacing product brands that consumers were interested in, offering more appealing promotions, and reducing sku quantity to ensure better inventory to meet customer demands.</p>

                <p class="work-description">While at Home Depot, I worked as a merchandise planner in paint – managing a variety of activities including our vendor relationship, product assortment, inventory, and planograms. One of the most innovative projects I worked on while there, was a large overhaul of our website. Previously the majority of sales were made in-store, but with the advent of Amazon into the home improvement space, a redesign of our website was necessary.  Alongside the merchant and our digital team, we worked to provide a more end-to-end.  To improve merchandising, we: (1) Expanded our online product assortment & vendors since we were no longer needed to restrict our product count to the shelf space available and no longer had to purchase inventory as most items were drop-shipped; (2) Ensured all products had sufficient product descriptions and photos to provide as close to an in-store experience as possible; (3) Added product carousels where we featured our best selling items, thereby encouraging customers to purchase products that would lead to a first-class painting experience. 
                <br></br>
                Although my team was skilled at merchandising, there were many parts of the online experience that we relied on our digital counterparts to provide advice on.  Some of the resources they provided to ensure our design choices were meeting customer needs was helping us organize the website layout and carousel features.  One particularly helpful insight was the fact that customers in the home improvement space prefer to shop by project.  While merchandising in this way in-store is not possible, due to the large variety of projects that a DIYer might partake in, it was easy to merchandise in this way online. Thus, in carousels we featured items by project type (ex: interior paint project, exterior paint project, crafts, ect). Additionally our digital partners also helped to ensure our website design was engaging thereby having us feature a finished project shot as the main feature of the paint landing page to inspire customers, and we worked to build out step-by-step guides (featuring photos) on how to complete projects for a beginner. 
                <br></br>
                After our initial round of design, we saw +25% comps as more and more customers became more aware of our online offerings and the fact that you could receive some of the same advice they used to need to go in-store to receive, online!</p>

                <p class="work-description">To examine benefits of administering stem cells to treat ischemic stroke, I conducted rigorous A/B testing to evaluate whether depression-like behavior would be reduced. Furthermore, I found that if I hypoxically pre-conditioned the BMSCs (causing them to express greater quantities of oxytocin) that one could also reduce anti-social behavior. 
                <br></br>
                In order to better understand why the behavioral changes occurred, I additionally completed cellular testing. I found in our model that of ischemic stroke that behavioral changes are likely due to downregulated oxytocin and altered thalamic connectivity, which is largely attenuated by treatment with BMSCs. </p>
